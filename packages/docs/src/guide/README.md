# Introduction

This project is a IOT-Dashboard called Data-pixel by which you can manage realtime data and display this data onto graphs. Data Pixel also provides user authentication/roles, where the owner can manage the accounts and create new ones.

The dashboard also provides certain predictions about the sensor data, which indicates if something is about to happen. (tbd)
